# Twilio's OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documents for [Twilio's API](https://docs.twilio.com).

Files can be found in the json/ and yaml/ directories.

## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface document for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface documentation have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

## Project Status

This project is currently in **BETA**. We expect the spec to be accurate, but it is currently in **active development** and **unsupported**. If you've identified a mismatch between Twilio's API behavior and this specification, [please open an issue](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-oai/issues/new).

## Contributing

Because this document is used across Twilio's whole API development experience, these documents are automatically kept up to date and used to validate Twilio API requests.
